Transmit synthesized text of "Android speech recognizer" to your Linux or old Windows PC.

2 years when I wrote the software, I used to solve programming problems at online judges so much regorously. My girlfriend was used to text me on WhatsApp but most of the time I was too lazy to write replies of her text. It would have been better if I had a soft keyboard with speech recognition support in my Manjaro linux setup. That time I found no easy solution (in sense of powerful tool like google speech synhtesizer). So I thought it would be better if I could synthesize voice using my Android smartphone and send the synthesized text back to the textBox of WhatsappWeb with just one shortcut on my keyboard. And rest is a history. It took almost 7 days and 7 night to write this tool.
