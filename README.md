# Peraless
Transmit synthesized text of "Android speech recognizer" to your Linux or old Windows PC.

# Shane Nujul
When I wrote the software two years ago, I used to solve programming problems on online judges rigorously. My girlfriend would message me on WhatsApp, but I often felt too lazy to reply. I wished for a soft keyboard with speech recognition support on my Manjaro Linux setup, but I couldn't find an easy solution with a powerful tool like Google's speech synthesizer. So, I came up with the idea of using my Android smartphone to synthesize voice and send the synthesized text back to the WhatsAppWeb textBox with just one keyboard shortcut. It took me seven days and nights to develop this tool, and the rest is history.

# Naming Reason
Prior to uploading the project to GitHub, I didn't assign a name to it. As with my other projects, I randomly named it "WebSocket" because I was experimenting with WebSocket technology. I continued to add features until I achieved all the necessary functionality, but the name remained the same.
As I was uploading the project, I decided to give it a name. Since the project helped reduce my worries or "pera," I named it "Peraless."

# Installation
At present, in order to use this software, you need to download a version of QT and build the project, although there may be alternative methods available.
